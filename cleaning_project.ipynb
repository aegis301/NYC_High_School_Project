    "# Investiagating School Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: This project is based on the data cleaning walkthrough provided by dataquest.io. Though my own take on this project might differ from what can be found on their website.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Project\n",
    "In this project I will try to showcase my skills in data cleaning, data exploration and presentation. While I will perform some analyses on this project, they will remain at a lower level of complexity. If you want to see my performance on more complex issues, I would refer you to my other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question\n",
    "In this project, I will try to investigate whether standardized testing in U.S. highschools is efficiant and if certain groups are at a disadvantage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "In order to answer said question, I am going to use publicly accessible SAT data from 2012 from the city of New York. In order to investigate demographics I need more data though. Here's a list of all datasets I am going to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "* [School attendance]() - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "* [Class size]() - Information on class size for each school\n",
    "* [AP test results]() - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "* [Graduation outcomes]() - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    "* [Demographics]() - Demographic information for each school\n",
    "* [School survey]() - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school\n",
